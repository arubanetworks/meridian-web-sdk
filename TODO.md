### NEXT

- Placemarks!
- Change tag `categories` to `labels`
- Expose API object representing the map with methods and such

### OTHER

- Include a mode where the SVG is rasterized at a few specific sizes in order to
  increase performance (mostly a Firefox thing)
- Center the map markers (offset by half width/height)
- Make a new hidden page with copy/paste API code
- Figure out versioning of the SDK
- Can we stop making like 500 style tags or is that our life now?
- Where to show messaging (looking for tag etc.)
- don't scale map markers
- map style support (eventually)
  - maybe have the editor apply the styles inline to the SVG?
- map scale ([_____] = 50 ft)

Messaging:

- Tag not found
- No connection

Possible internal staff to play client:

- Tye
