### NEXT

- Add placemarks of type to option toggles
- Should labels be case insensitive?
- Culling! (openstreetmap/ID uses RBush)

### NEED

- `@meridian` namespace on npm
- What license for the library?
- Open source on GitHub or keep it private and only publish minified source on
  GCS and npm
- Rename repo to `meridian-web-sdk`

### PERFORMANCE

- Do indepth performance testing
- The number of placemarks/tags on the map seems to directly affect performance
  in Chrome on Android
- Using a background SVG for the map directly affects performance in Firefox

### OTHER

- Make a new hidden page with copy/paste API code
- Figure out versioning of the SDK
- Map style support (eventually)
  - Maybe have the editor apply the styles inline to the SVG?
- Map scale ([_____] = 50 ft)
